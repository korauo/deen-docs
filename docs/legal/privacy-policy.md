### Usage of Data

No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

---

### Updating Data
The data may be updated when using specific features of the bot.  

Such updates of data often requires the input of a user, including data that can be seen as identifiable and sensitive, such as text messages. This data is only kept in the database and only used for its intended purpose.



Temporarily stored Information
The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time to reduce requests to its database.  

After a specified time period will the cached data be discared and only re-aquired when needed.



Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.



Removal of Data
Automatic removal

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by using the moderation features provided by Discord.  

Re-adding the bot back to the server will store data again, as described in the [Stored Information](#stored-information) section of this policy.



Manual removal

Manual removal of the data can be requested through discord by messaging me @korauo.  

For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
